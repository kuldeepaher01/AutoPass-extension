# AutoPass :key:

AutoPass, because we all know we are too busy to type in our login credentials every time we need to access college websites. Who has time for that when there are assignments to procrastinate on?

## Installation :computer:
1.  Download the extension by clicking on the green "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP" or just by clicking [here](https://github.com/kuldeepaher01/AutoPass-extension/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Don't worry, we know you're probably not using Git.
1.  Extract the downloaded ZIP file. It's almost like opening a Christmas present, except the only thing you're getting is a Chrome extension. Yay, technology!  
2.  Open your Chrome or Brave browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`. This is where the magic happens, folks. Get ready to be blown away.   
3.  Turn on "Developer mode" in the top right corner. Because you're clearly a developer if you're installing this. You don't need a degree or anything, just a desire to automate everything in your life.
4.  Click on "Load unpacked" in the top left corner. This is the equivalent of building your own rocket ship. Except, you know, not really.
5.  Select the extracted folder from step 2. Congratulations, you just completed the hardest part of your engineering degree. Who needs to study for four years when you can install a Chrome extension in five easy steps?
6.  Select the extracted folder from step 2. Finally, a task you can finish without procrastinating!

## Usage :key:

1.  After installation, there will be a popup where you'll be asked to enter your login credentials. Because we all know how much students love giving away their personal information.
2.  Open the website you want to log in to. We recommend choosing a website that has nothing to do with your coursework, just for the thrill of it.
3.  The extension will automatically detect if you have saved credentials for that website. If not, it will prompt you to enter them. Don't worry, your information is completely safe with AutoPass. Trust us.
4.  Once you have entered your credentials, the extension will save them securely in your browser's storage. So now you can rest easy knowing that your login credentials are in the hands of a Chrome extension. What could go wrong?
5.  The next time you visit the same website, the extension will automatically fill in your saved credentials and log you in. Because who has time to remember their login information when there are more important things to worry about, like passing your exams.

## Uninstallation :computer:

1.  Open your browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`. We know, it's a lot of work.
2.  Click on "remove" on the extension card. It's like saying goodbye to an old friend who did all your homework for you.
3.  Click confirmation. We know it's hard to let go, but it's time to move on to the next Chrome extension that will do all your work for you.

## Disclaimer :warning:

This extension was created for educational purposes only and should not be used to breach any website's security or violate any terms of service. But let's be real, as a student, you're probably going to use it to log into your friend's account to check their grades. The creator of this extension is not responsible for any misuse of the extension. But who are we kidding? You're going to misuse it anyway.

:rocket: Enjoy your stress-free login experience with AutoPass! :rocket:

## Contributions ü§ù

Ah, yes, let's talk about contributions. We all know that feeling of being in college and realizing that you have no idea what you're doing with your life. But fear not, because contributing to open source projects like AutoPass is the perfect way to distract yourself from the existential crisis that is looming over you.

And let's not forget about Aryan Pokharkar, who made a valuable contribution to this project. I mean, who knew that selecting details in VIERP could be so complicated? We should all be grateful for Aryan's activa efforts in helping us log in to VIERP without having to exert our precious brain cells.

But really, who needs real-life experience when you can just add a line or two to a Chrome extension? So, don't be shy, contribute to this project and feel like a real programmer, even if you're just a beginner with no real-world experience.
